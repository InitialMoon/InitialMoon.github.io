I am a first-year PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof.
Linpeng Huang and Prof. Shengan Zheng. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from
Beijing Institute of Technology in 2025.

My research interests focus on microkernel-based architectures, but extend
beyond traditional microkernels to include modern approaches that explore the
separation of kernel components into user space, such as
